Instructions for enabling the git pre-commit hook or running the sanity scripts from a linux terminal window.

If your device is named something other than /dev/nvme0n1 then you will need to update all the scripts with the corect device/file name.  
open a terminal window in your fio sanity folder
change the following commands to represent your device.  Change the nvme1n1 to your device name
then copy and paste the commands into the terminal window to execute:
grep -rl nvme0n1 | xargs sed -i 's/nvme0n1/nvme1n1/g'
grep -rl nvme0 | xargs sed -i 's/nvme0/nvme1/g'

You will need to have python2 or python3 installed.  
Check if you have one of them:
python2 --version
python3 --version
If not install one of them.
If you have python2 then execute the following command in the sanity folder:
grep -rl python3 | xargs sed -i 's/python3/python2/g'

To run the scripts use the following command in the sanity folder:
sudo bash zns_sanity.sh

to enable the git pre-commit hook to run when issuing a git commit
from fio folder edit .git/hooks/pre-commit
Copy and paste the following 8 lines into pre-commit file then save
#!/bin/bash
cd sanity
sudo sh zns_sanity.sh
if [ $? != 0 ] ; 
then
  exit 1
fi
exit 0

Make sure the pre-commit is executable:
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
